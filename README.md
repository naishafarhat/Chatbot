This is a full-stack AI chatbot project that uses a Python/Flask backend
<br>
It has a clean web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To run this project locally, you will need Python, Flask, and the google-generativeai library 
<br>
you can use the command (pip install Flask google-generativeai) to install the package.
<br>
First we get a free API key from Google AI Studio. Then we set a key as an environment variable in the terminal (e.g., export GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_KEY' for macOS/Linux or set GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY for Windows). 
<br>
Finally we  run the backend server with python app.py and open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to start chatting with the AI.
Since this chatbot uses a limited number of if else elif statments we wont be able to chat or interact with it beyond of what it is made for , so the chat willl be limited to certain basic questions.
